Module 8
Amazing Prime would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular to buy the movies rights at a bargain. By hosting a hack-a-thon and providing movie data, they hope to predict the next popular movies. The goal is to extract, transform and load a clean data set for the hackers to work from.
